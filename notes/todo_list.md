- [ ] Make a function and format saved datasets/datalist to be more easily usable
  across devices where the paths are different
- Inferred labels should be named in such a way that indicates which training
  they were produced from
- The new Scan class should have a function that returns all niftis in its root folder
- The new Scan class should have a function that returns all subdirectories in
  its root folder
