# Segmentation Notes

## Choroid Plexus

### Choroid 1

- 30 in training data
- Input 2 channels (t1, flair)

- sub-ms1003 may be under-labeled
- sub-ms1007 missing a sliver?

### Choroid Resegment

## Pituitary

- sub-ms1005 has discontinuities in a slice (e.g. coronal)

## Pineal

- ms1010 good besides extraneous region
- ms1029 got the pineal, but got large extraneous region too
- ms1188 got pineal but underlabeled

## Inference Notes

### sub-ms1038

- No pineal
- Very scant choroid label, but scan is low quality, abnormal looking
- Pituitary over labeled

### sub-ms1071
