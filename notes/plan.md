# Plan

Choroids in the MS group are smaller than the !MS group. Need to figure out if this is a real effect or an artifact of the automatic segmentation

1. Manually inspect
2. Train auto3dseg on all combinations so that we have 40 automatic segmentations to compare with manuals
3. Long way: manually segment a random selection of the subjects and compare volumes

## Manually Inspecting
