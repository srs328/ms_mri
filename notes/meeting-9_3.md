# Meeting Notes

- Compare actual DICE scores with training progress to see if overfit?
- Splitting of training and test data in folds, rotating out test data?

## Questions for follow up

- How was the segmentation done for choroid with both t1 and flair
- Look at the lymphatics segmentation
- How does training work over folds (versus traditional k fold cross validation)
