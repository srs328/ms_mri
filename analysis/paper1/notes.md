# Notes

## Deciding which model

- Bland-Altman plots
- Note that with the flair model, use of flair_contrast
  - flair contrast is a significant covariate for predicting all volumes

## Analysis

- How do the structures' volumes correlate with eachother
- Plot EDSS against volumes
- Read [this](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2022/05/20/marginalia/) in depth explanation about marginal means
- Check [this](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/plots_boxplots.html) documentation about stats models regression plots (eg partial regression plots)
